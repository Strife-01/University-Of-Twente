Binary search is used to logarithmically search a value in a list of sorted values.
We start by getting the mid value between the first index and the last index.
If we found our value we are done, if not then we have to check if the found mid value is higher or lower than our searched value.
If it is lower we check again but in the lower left to mid - 1 and if it is higher we check in the higher mid + 1 right half.
If left is bigger than right it means that the value is not in the list of values.
